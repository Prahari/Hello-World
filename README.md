#Variable Definition:
#Variables are used to store values so we can refer to them later. 
#A variable is like a label, and you use the ' =' symbol, known as the assignment operator, to assign a value to a variable. 
#An assignment can be chained, e.g. a = b = 2 
#a = b = 2  # This is called a "chained assignment". It assigns the value 2 to variables "a" and "b".
#print("a = " + str(a))   # We'll explain the expression str(a) later in the course. For now it is used to convert the  variable "a" to a string.
#print("b = " + str(b))
